    "### What is a NoSQL Database?\n",
    "\n",
    "A NoSQL database is a non-relational database.  Since some NoSQL databases allow commands written using SQL a more accurate term would be a \"non relational\" database.   \n",
    "\n",
    "**Types and examples of NoSQL databases**   \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There have been various approaches to classify NoSQL databases, each\n",
    "with different categories and subcategories, some of which overlap. What\n",
    "follows is a basic classification by data model, with examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Column**: Accumulo, Cassandra, Druid, HBase, Vertica.   \n",
    "-   **Document**: Apache CouchDB, ArangoDB, BaseX,\n",
    "    Clusterpoint, Couchbase, Cosmos DB, IBM Domino, MarkLogic,\n",
    "    MongoDB, OrientDB, Qizx, RethinkDB     \n",
    "-   **Key-value**: Aerospike, Apache Ignite, ArangoDB,\n",
    "    Couchbase, Dynamo, FairCom c-treeACE, FoundationDB,\n",
    "    InfinityDB, MemcacheDB, MUMPS, Oracle NoSQL Database,\n",
    "    OrientDB, Redis, Riak, Berkeley DB, SDBM/Flat File dbm,\n",
    "    ZooKeeper    \n",
    "-   **Graph**: AllegroGraph, ArangoDB, InfiniteGraph, Apache\n",
    "    Giraph, MarkLogic, Neo4J, OrientDB, Virtuoso   \n",
    "-   **Multi-model**: Apache Ignite, ArangoDB, Couchbase,\n",
    "    FoundationDB, InfinityDB, MarkLogic, OrientDB   \n",
    "\n",
    "A more detailed classification see the free book _NoSQL Databases_ [http://www.christof-strauch.de/nosqldbs](http://www.christof-strauch.de/nosqldbs) by Christof Strauch.   \n",
    "\n",
    "### Key-value store\n",
    "\n",
    "Key-value (KV) stores use the associative array (also known as a map\n",
    "or dictionary) as their fundamental data model. In this model, data is\n",
    "represented as a collection of key-value pairs, such that each possible\n",
    "key appears at most once in the collection.   \n",
    "\n",
    "The key-value model is one of the simplest non-trivial data models, and\n",
    "richer data models are often implemented as an extension of it. The\n",
    "key-value model can be extended to a discretely ordered model that\n",
    "maintains keys in lexicographic order. This extension is\n",
    "computationally powerful, in that it can efficiently retrieve selective\n",
    "key *ranges*.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Key-value stores can use consistency models ranging from eventual\n",
    "consistency to serializability. Some databases support ordering of\n",
    "keys. There are various hardware implementations, and some users\n",
    "maintain data in memory (RAM), while others employ solid-state drives\n",
    "(SSD) or rotating disks (aka Hard Disk Drive (HDD)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples include ArangoDB, InfinityDB, Riak, Oracle NoSQL Database,\n",
    "Redis, and dbm.\n",
    "\n",
    "* A KV-DB is essentially a lookup table that often uses hashing to speed up retrieval.  \n",
    "* KV-DBs scale easily and have high performance.    \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Document store\n",
    "\n",
    "The central concept of a document store is the notion of a \\\"document\\\".\n",
    "While each document-oriented database implementation differs on the\n",
    "details of this definition, in general, they all assume that documents\n",
    "encapsulate and encode data (or information) in some standard formats or\n",
    "encodings. Encodings in use include XML, YAML, and JSON as well as\n",
    "binary forms like BSON. Documents are addressed in the database via a\n",
    "unique *key* that represents that document. One of the other defining\n",
    "characteristics of a document-oriented database is that in addition to\n",
    "the key lookup performed by a key-value store, the database also offers\n",
    "an API or query language that retrieves documents based on their\n",
    "contents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Different implementations offer different ways of organizing and/or\n",
    "grouping documents:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Collections\n",
    "-   Tags\n",
    "-   Non-visible metadata\n",
    "-   Directory hierarchies\n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to relational databases, for example, collections could be\n",
    "considered analogous to tables and documents analogous to records. But\n",
    "they are different: every record in a table has the same sequence of\n",
    "fields, while documents in a collection may have fields that are\n",
    "completely different.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Document databases such as MongoDB and CouchDBare very similar to columnar databases but allow for much deeper nesting of information.  \n",
    "* Performance is often an issue with these databases.  \n",
    "* XML Stores are an example of a document database.  \n",
    "* Document databases often use JavaScript as the native query language with data being exchanged between the client and the server using JSON object.   \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Columnar databases   \n",
    "\n",
    "* Columnar databases, such as HBase, are similar to key-value databases in that they store keys with information.\n",
    "* Rather than storing a single value, a columnar database stores multiple pieces of information – similar to a record.  \n",
    "* The columns do not have to be of the same data type.  \n",
    "* Unlike relational schemas, column-based stores do not require a pre-structured table.   \n",
    "* Each record is comprised of one or more columns containing the information and each column of each record can be different.   \n",
    "* Columnar databases allow very large and un-structured data to be managed.   \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Graph\n",
    "\n",
    "This kind of database is designed for data whose relations are well\n",
    "represented as a graph consisting of elements interconnected with a\n",
    "finite number of relations between them. The type of data could be\n",
    "social relations, public transport links, road maps, network topologies,\n",
    "etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Graph databases such as Neo4J use “graphs” with nodes and edges connecting each other through relationships.     \n",
    "* These databases are best when the data is represented by “networks” and a “deep connection” must be tracked, such as social networks.    \n",
    "\n",
    "### ACID database transactions\n",
    " \n",
    "The characteristics of these four ACID properties as defined by Reuter and\n",
    "Härder are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Atomicity\n",
    "\n",
    "Atomicity requires that each transaction be \\\"all or nothing\\\": if one\n",
    "part of the transaction fails, then the entire transaction fails, and\n",
    "the database state is left unchanged. An atomic system must guarantee\n",
    "atomicity in each and every situation, including power failures, errors\n",
    "and crashes. To the outside world, a committed transaction appears (by\n",
    "its effects on the database) to be indivisible (\\\"atomic\\\"), and an\n",
    "aborted transaction does not happen.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Consistency\n",
    "\n",
    "The consistency property ensures that any transaction will bring the\n",
    "database from one valid state to another. Any data written to the\n",
    "database must be valid according to all defined rules, including\n",
    "constraints, cascades, triggers, and any combination thereof. This\n",
    "does not guarantee correctness of the transaction in all ways the\n",
    "application programmer might have wanted (that is the responsibility of\n",
    "application-level code), but merely that any programming errors cannot\n",
    "result in the violation of any defined rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Isolation\n",
    "\n",
    "The isolation property ensures that the concurrent execution of\n",
    "transactions results in a system state that would be obtained if\n",
    "transactions were executed sequentially, i.e., one after the other.\n",
    "Providing isolation is the main goal of concurrency control. Depending\n",
    "on the concurrency control method (i.e., if it uses strict - as opposed\n",
    "to relaxed - serializability), the effects of an incomplete\n",
    "transaction might not even be visible to another transaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Durability\n",
    "\n",
    "The durability property ensures that once a transaction has been\n",
    "committed, it will remain so, even in the event of power loss,\n",
    "crashes, or errors. In a relational database, for instance, once a\n",
    "group of SQL statements execute, the results need to be stored\n",
    "permanently (even if the database crashes immediately thereafter). To\n",
    "defend against power loss, transactions (or their effects) must be\n",
    "recorded in a non-volatile memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "ACID provides principles governing how changes are applied to a database. In a very simplified way, it states):\n",
    "\n",
    "(A) when you do something to change a database the change should work or fail as a whole  \n",
    "(C) the database should remain consistent  \n",
    "(I) if other things are going on at the same time they shouldn't be able to see things mid-update  \n",
    "(D) if the system blows up (hardware or software) the database needs to be able to pick itself back up   \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Relational databases usually guarantee ACID properties related to how reliably transactions (both reads and writes) are processed. MySQL and PostgreSQL are examples of database that provide these properties as a selling point.\n",
    "\n",
    "The NoSQL movement trades off ACID compliance for other properties, such as 100% availability, or speed.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### CAP theorem  \n",
    "\n",
    "In theoretical computer science, the **CAP theorem**, also named\n",
    "**Brewer\\'s theorem** after computer scientist Eric Brewer, states\n",
    "that it is impossible for a distributed data store to simultaneously\n",
    "provide more than two out of the following three guarantees:\n",
    "\n",
    "  *Consistency*                                           \n",
    "  \n",
    "Every read receives the most recent write or an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "   \n",
    "  *Availability*                \n",
    "  \n",
    " Every request receives a (non-error) response – without guarantee that it contains the most recent write.   \n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    " *Partition tolerance*  \n",
    " \n",
    " The system continues to operate despite an arbitrary number of messages being dropped (or delayed) by the network between nodes\n",
    " \n",
    "In other words, the CAP theorem states that in the presence of a network\n",
    "partition, one has to choose between consistency and availability. Note\n",
    "that consistency as defined in the CAP theorem is quite different from\n",
    "the consistency guaranteed in ACID database transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "See _Please stop calling databases CP or AP_ (“CP” (consistent but not available under network partitions), “AP” (available but not consistent under network partitions)  [https://martin.kleppmann.com/2015/05/11/please-stop-calling-databases-cp-or-ap.html](https://martin.kleppmann.com/2015/05/11/please-stop-calling-databases-cp-or-ap.html)  "
