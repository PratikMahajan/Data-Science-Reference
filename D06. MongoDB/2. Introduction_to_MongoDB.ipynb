    "With MongoDB, you may embed related data in a single structure or document. These schema are generally known as “denormalized” models, and take advantage of MongoDB’s rich documents. Consider the following diagram:\n",

    "**Normalized Data Models**\n",
    "\n",
    "Normalized data models describe relationships using references between documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "![MongoDB Normalized Data Models](http://nikbearbrown.com/YouTube/MachineLearning/IMG/data-model-normalized.bakedsvg.svg.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, use normalized data models:\n",
    "\n",
    "* When embedding would result in duplication of data but would not provide sufficient read performance advantages to outweigh the implications of the duplication.\n",
    "* To represent more complex many-to-many relationships.  \n",
    "* To model large hierarchical data sets.  \n",
    "* To mimic relational models. \n",
    "\n",
    "References provides more flexibility than embedding. However, client-side applications must issue follow-up queries to resolve the references. In other words, normalized data models can require more round trips to the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sharding**  \n",
    "\n",
    "Sharding is a type of database partitioning that separates very large databases the into smaller, faster, more easily managed parts called data shards. The word shard means a small part of a whole.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Sharding is a method for distributing data across multiple machines. MongoDB uses sharding to support deployments with very large data sets and high throughput operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Database systems with large data sets or high throughput applications can challenge the capacity of a single server. For example, high query rates can exhaust the CPU capacity of the server. Working set sizes larger than the system’s RAM stress the I/O capacity of disk drives.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two methods for addressing system growth: vertical and horizontal scaling.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Vertical Scaling_  \n",
    "\n",
    "Vertical Scaling involves increasing the capacity of a single server, such as using a more powerful CPU, adding more RAM, or increasing the amount of storage space. Limitations in available technology may restrict a single machine from being sufficiently powerful for a given workload. Additionally, Cloud-based providers have hard ceilings based on available hardware configurations. As a result, there is a practical maximum for vertical scaling.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Horizontal Scaling_  \n",
    "\n",
    "Horizontal Scaling involves dividing the system dataset and load over multiple servers, adding additional servers to increase capacity as required. While the overall speed or capacity of a single machine may not be high, each machine handles a subset of the overall workload, potentially providing better efficiency than a single high-speed high-capacity server. Expanding the capacity of the deployment only requires adding additional servers as needed, which can be a lower overall cost than high-end hardware for a single machine. The trade off is increased complexity in infrastructure and maintenance for the deployment.\n"

The mongo shell will prompt Type it to iterate another 20 times.\n",
